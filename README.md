# Issue of self-referential type in gen-flow-files command

## Problem

Union type with self-referential can't be generated using `gen-flow-files`. For example, the following case.

```javascript
export type Foo = number | Foo[];

const num: Foo = 1;
const ary: Foo = [1, 2];
```

## Environment

- flow-bin: 0.86.0
- Node.js: 10.11.0
- OS: macOS 10.13.6

## Preparation

```
npm install
```

## Test

```
npm test

> issue-of-self-reference-type@1.0.0 test /Users/nobyu/git/issue-of-self-reference-type
> npx mocha tests/**
